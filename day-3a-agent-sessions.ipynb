It's one of the most active and promising areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI analyzing multi-omics data:** AI platforms are becoming increasingly sophisticated at integrating and analyzing vast datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This allows them to identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins) that were previously unknown or difficult to pinpoint.\n*   **Predicting target druggability:** AI models are being trained to assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be amenable to drug intervention, saving time and resources.\n\n**2. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Creating entirely new drug candidates:** This is a major leap. Instead of just screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like those based on diffusion models or generative adversarial networks - GANs) can *design* novel molecules from scratch that have specific desired properties, such as binding affinity to a target, solubility, and low toxicity.\n*   **\"De novo\" drug design:** This term is frequently used to describe this process of creating entirely new molecular structures.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are reporting the design of novel drug candidates for conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various cancers using these generative approaches.\n\n**3. Enhanced Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting compound properties:** AI is used to predict a wide range of properties for newly designed or screened compounds, including:\n    *   **ADMET properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. This helps identify potential issues early on.\n    *   **Efficacy and potency:** How well a drug is likely to work.\n    *   **Off-target effects:** Predicting unintended interactions with other biological molecules that could lead to side effects.\n*   **Virtual screening optimization:** AI can make virtual screening of large compound libraries much more efficient by prioritizing compounds that are most likely to be successful.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n\n*   **Patient stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting trial outcomes:** AI models are being developed to forecast the likelihood of success for a clinical trial based on preclinical data and early human trial results.\n*   **Optimizing trial protocols:** AI can help design more efficient trial protocols, potentially reducing the duration and cost of trials.\n\n**5. AI for Drug Repurposing:**\n\n*   **Finding new uses for existing drugs:** AI can sift through massive amounts of scientific literature, clinical trial data, and real-world evidence to identify existing drugs that could be effective against new diseases. This can significantly shorten the development timeline as safety data is already available.\n\n**Specific Examples and Buzzwords You Might See:**\n\n*   **\"AI-first drug discovery companies\":** Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise, BenevolentAI, Exscientia, Insitro, and Schrödinger are at the forefront, often announcing partnerships or pipeline advancements.\n*   **\"End-to-end AI drug discovery platforms\":** Companies offering comprehensive solutions from target identification to preclinical candidate selection.\n*   **\"Machine learning for molecular property prediction.\"**\n*   **\"Deep learning for drug design.\"**\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these incredible advancements, it's important to note that drug discovery is a long and complex process. While AI can dramatically speed things up, it doesn't eliminate the need for rigorous experimental validation, clinical trials, and regulatory approval. However, the impact of AI is undeniable, and we are seeing more AI-discovered or AI-designed drug candidates entering various stages of development than ever before.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just assisting in drug discovery; it's fundamentally transforming the process by making it faster, more efficient, and capable of exploring entirely new therapeutic possibilities.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **second development I mentioned: Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design.** This is truly one of the most exciting frontiers in AI-driven drug discovery.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n\n1.  **Identifying a biological target** (e.g., a protein involved in a disease).\n2.  **Screening vast libraries of existing chemical compounds** to find ones that bind to and modulate the target's activity. This is like searching for a specific key in a huge box of pre-made keys.\n3.  **Optimizing the properties** of promising \"hits\" through chemical modifications.\n\n**Generative AI flips this on its head.** Instead of just searching through what already exists, generative AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying \"rules\" of molecular structure and how these structures relate to biological activity. Then, they can:\n\n*   **Create entirely new molecular structures** that have never been seen before.\n*   **Design molecules with specific, desired characteristics.**\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n*   **Training Data:** The AI is fed millions of chemical structures and their associated data (e.g., whether they bind to a certain target, their toxicity, their solubility).\n*   **Learning the \"Language\" of Molecules:** The AI learns the fundamental building blocks of molecules (atoms, bonds, functional groups) and how they can be assembled. It learns which combinations tend to result in certain properties.\n*   **Generating New Molecules:** Based on its training, the AI can then be prompted to design new molecules. You can ask it to:\n    *   \"Design a molecule that binds strongly to this specific protein.\"\n    *   \"Design a molecule with high efficacy and low toxicity.\"\n    *   \"Design a molecule that is similar to this existing drug but with improved properties.\"\n\n**Key Technologies Involved:**\n\n*   **Deep Learning Models:** Primarily, these include:\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) work against each other to create increasingly realistic and valid molecular structures.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation of molecules and can then decode this representation to generate new ones.\n    *   **Transformer Models (similar to those used in LLMs like me):** These are increasingly being adapted for molecular generation and property prediction.\n    *   **Diffusion Models:** A newer class of generative models showing great promise for generating high-quality molecular structures.\n\n**Why is this a Game-Changer?**\n\n1.  **Access to Novel Chemical Space:** Generative AI allows researchers to explore chemical spaces that are not represented in existing compound libraries. This means discovering entirely new classes of drugs that might be more effective or have novel mechanisms of action.\n2.  **Speed and Efficiency:** Designing molecules computationally is far faster and cheaper than synthesizing and testing them in the lab. AI can explore millions of potential candidates in a fraction of the time.\n3.  **Tailored Design:** Instead of finding a \"good enough\" molecule and trying to tweak it, AI can design molecules with a pre-defined set of optimal properties from the outset. This can drastically reduce the number of failed candidates.\n4.  **Addressing \"Undruggable\" Targets:** For targets that have been notoriously difficult to drug with traditional methods, generative AI offers a new approach to design molecules that can interact with them.\n\n**Real-World Impact:**\n\nCompanies are actively using generative AI to:\n\n*   **Discover novel inhibitors** for cancer targets.\n*   **Design new antibiotics** to combat resistant bacteria.\n*   **Create potential treatments** for neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Generate molecules** with specific pharmacokinetic properties for better drug delivery.\n\n**In essence, generative AI is moving drug discovery from an explorative search to a creative design process.** It's empowering scientists to engineer the precise molecular tools needed to fight disease.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies leading the charge in **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**.

Specialized AI/ML Companies and Platform Providers:**\n\nSome companies focus on providing the underlying AI technologies or platforms that drug discovery companies can then utilize.\n\n*   **NVIDIA:** While not directly a drug discovery company, NVIDIA's powerful GPUs and specialized AI platforms (like Clara Discovery) are essential for training and running the complex models used in generative molecular design. They often collaborate with pharma and biotech.\n*   **Google (Verily Life Sciences):** Google's life sciences arm has been involved in various AI applications in healthcare, including drug discovery and potentially generative design.\n*   **Microsoft (through partnerships and Azure AI):** Similar to NVIDIA, Microsoft provides cloud computing and AI tools that enable generative AI research in drug discovery.\n\n**4. Emerging Startups:**\n\nThe field is so dynamic that new startups are constantly emerging, often with unique angles on generative AI for specific therapeutic areas or molecular modalities. It's hard to name them all, but new funding rounds and breakthroughs are frequently announced.\n\n**Key Trends to Note:**\n\n*   **Partnerships are crucial:** Many AI-first companies partner with Big Pharma to leverage their deep clinical expertise, vast datasets, and ability to take drugs through later-stage development.\n*   **Focus on specific modalities:** Some companies might specialize in generative design for small molecules, while others focus on biologics (proteins, antibodies) or even more complex modalities.\n*   **The \"end-to-end\" ambition:** Many companies aim to build comprehensive platforms that cover the entire drug discovery pipeline, with generative design being a critical component.\n\nWhen you see news about generative AI in drug discovery, it's often these types of companies announcing new partnerships, drug candidate nominations, or advancements in their AI platforms.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
